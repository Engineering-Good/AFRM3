Introduction
############

The aim of the Automated Flag Raising Machine (AFRM) is to allow students with
disabilities to participate in flag raising ceremonies.

The AFRM3 is the third iteration of a motorised machine to pull a flag rope at
the push of a button.

This project was developed for `Engineering Good`_.
